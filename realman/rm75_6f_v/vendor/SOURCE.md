The Python-only vendored subset is about 590 KB; the 1.5 MB shared library is
neither stored in Git nor redistributed in the image. It must be provisioned
on each robot host from the operator's licensed SDK copy.

Local patch: the wrapper version and invalid-pose diagnostics use DEBUG logging
instead of unconditional stdout prints. SDK calls and return codes are unchanged.
