# External camera: RGB, depth and infrared

`ext_camera` is a multi-instance sensor (`multiInstance: true`). Each card has its own configuration containing
`channel: rgb | depth | infrared` (default `rgb`). There are no executable
camera-control actions. `config`, `start`, `stop` and `info` are internal
lifecycle operations, with plain-dict responses.

`camera_front` remains the Go2's built-in front video service. This card uses
external USB cameras. Normal USB webcams support `rgb`; depth and infrared
require a compatible RealSense with a resolvable physical USB path.

## Configure and switch

1. Add one or more `ext_camera` cards. Configure each card's camera device and `channel` independently.
2. For RGB, choose an advertised resolution, pixel format and frame rate.
   RGB settings are preserved when switching to another channel; depth/IR
   use their fixed profiles and ignore these RGB-only fields.
3. Save. A running instance releases its old channel and starts the selected
   one. An idle instance stays idle until started. Invalid configuration is
   rejected before releasing a working channel.
4. **Refresh the page/reopen data details after changing channel.** The current
   Agent Core does not automatically refresh an existing card's cached output
   port and renderer after saving instance configuration. Use the topic and
   format returned by `info`; an already-open old-channel viewer is not changed
   by the driver. If the canvas still uses an old cached port, reopen the card's
   details to read its current output before opening the stream.

Each card publishes its selected modality on its own topic. Configuration and
start calls require its canvas `instance_id`; info and stop accept the same ID:

| channel | topic | format | payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rgb` | `/{namespace}/ext_camera/{instance_id}/rgb` | `image/jpeg` | Color JPEG |
| `depth` | `/{namespace}/ext_camera/{instance_id}/depth` | `image/depth-zlib` | zlib of 640x480 little-endian uint16 millimetres |
| `infrared` | `/{namespace}/ext_camera/{instance_id}/infrared` | `image/jpeg` | 640x480 left infrared Y8 encoded as grayscale JPEG |

Hyphens in instance IDs become underscores in ROS topic paths. Channel-specific
paths prevent a depth payload from being delivered to an old RGB subscription.
Existing downstream connections must be reviewed/reconnected for the newly
selected modality and format; they are not automatically rewired by the driver.

For example, create three cards with channels RGB, depth and infrared, then
start them together through Enable Intelligent Control. Their settings and
output topics remain separate. Depth/IR instances share one stereo device
owner; stopping one leaves the others active. The last stereo instance releases
the device. A physical RGB video node has one owner, so choose distinct cameras
for independent RGB sources rather than opening the same node twice.

The existing Core can start the instances and display their streams. Its
startup modal may nevertheless leave two same-name rows at "waiting": events
are keyed by capability name instead of instance ID. The companion
[Core startup fix](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus/pull/175) adds
instance identity to progress events and matches each row by that identity.
It is not a prerequisite for concurrent camera acquisition. Check each instance's
info and actual frames rather than interpreting the old modal as capture state.

## What each modality is useful for

| channel | Useful question | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RGB | What is visible, including color/text? | Remote inspection, input for OCR/object recognition |
| Depth | What is the depth at this image location? | Inspect nearby geometry, read pixel depth, inspect missing depth regions |
| Infrared | What intensity and texture does the stereo imager receive? | Diagnose depth quality; observe texture/target visibility under suitable illumination |

The most direct infrared use is alongside depth. When depth has holes or
unstable regions, inspect infrared for saturated highlights, poor texture,
occlusion or a poorly visible projector pattern. This helps investigate the
image input; the card does not implement an automatic diagnosis algorithm.

In weak visible light, available near-infrared illumination/projector light can
provide useful texture. The card does not add or control a light source. D400
stereo imagers also use visible light, so a bright room may resemble an ordinary
grayscale scene. The driver reads the native SDK `infrared` stream, index 1,
format `Y8`, rather than converting RGB into grayscale.

**D435i is not a thermal camera.** Brightness is reflected light intensity,
not temperature. Adding a palette would not turn it into a temperature
measurement. The left-only JPEG is for monitoring/algorithm input evaluation;
lossless capture, precision calibration or stereo matching requires additional
raw streams and calibration metadata. Recognition, navigation and complete
obstacle avoidance are downstream capabilities, not implemented by this sensor.

## Data and hardware constraints

- Depth uses the device's queried `get_depth_scale()` to convert to millimetres.
  Zero means invalid/unrepresentable. The payload is plain zlib of the pixel
  buffer, without a ROS compressedDepth transport header, matching the existing
  renderer. The view is not registered to RGB.
- Both modalities use `sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage` and best-effort QoS.
  Depth message format is `16UC1; compressedDepth zlib`; RGB/IR use `jpeg`.
- Stereo profiles are 640x480, 6fps on USB 2/unknown transport and 15fps on USB 3.
  `info` reports the actual selected profile, freshness and source stream/index.
  The fixed depth dimensions match the platform's headerless depth renderer.
- USB 2 uses conservative VGA/6 stereo profiles; USB 3 uses VGA/15.
  D435i RGB/depth/infrared switching has been verified on USB 3.2.
- Linux USB serial and RealSense SDK serial are not necessarily equal. Device
  selection binds SDK `physical_port` to the selected V4L2 node's USB ancestor:
  Linux V4L2 supplies an absolute depth-node sysfs path; Linux RSUSB supplies
  `bus-port.chain-device_address`, matched against that ancestor's `busnum`,
  `devpath` and `devnum`. Path boundaries and the full RSUSB identifier must
  match, so similar ports and stale USB addresses do not select another device.
  It does not choose an arbitrary first SDK camera or hard-code `/dev/video4`.
  A missing or unreadable sysfs identity skips only that RealSense node, so
  unplugging it does not abort discovery of unrelated webcams. Each stereo
  worker uses a stable USB-path hash in its ROS node name to distinguish devices.
- `start` returns lifecycle `state: running` after activation, with `readiness`
  and `fresh` preserved separately. `info` can report `starting` until frames
  arrive; only new frames count as fresh. Known capture errors are never hidden.
  Missing devices/profiles, process exit and stale data are reported by `info`.
  Start retries after a fault, and shutdown is bounded if the SDK is stuck.
  The worker allows 10 seconds after `sensor.start` for both first frames;
  after both streams have arrived, its stream-stall deadline is 3 seconds.

## Build and verification

The Dockerfile copies `realsense.py` and installs the official pinned
`pyrealsense2==2.56.5.9235` wheel in the existing dependency layer. Linux ARM64 /
CPython 3.10 availability and execution were verified. The SDK is needed for
calibrated depth scale and shared stereo acquisition. No Agent Core changes
are included in this driver PR.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

All 58 tests pass. They cover real V4L2 capability formatting, unsupported formats, channel
configuration/topic changes, USB device binding, RGB compatibility, per-instance configuration and lifecycle, stale/wrong-channel frames, depth units and overflow.
Worker-loop regressions also cover delayed first frames, missing streams,
post-start stalls and distinct node names for distinct physical USB paths.
Enumeration regressions cover sysfs resolution/ancestor failures while keeping
an unrelated webcam available. Updated enumeration was checked read-only on the
Go2; delayed USB startup and two-camera node naming were verified with SDK/ROS
test doubles, not a new two-camera hardware acceptance run.
SDK binding tests include a captured Go2/D435i V4L2 `physical_port` and the
RSUSB format from the pinned SDK source. The matcher was checked read-only
against the real SDK value and a compact ID derived from the same live sysfs
ancestor. Running a full RSUSB capture pipeline was not part of this check.
Hardware verification covers RGB→depth→infrared→RGB on the same instance,
actual decoded image payloads in earlier device runs. The current startup fix
has local coverage for three saved instance configurations starting separately,
standard lifecycle responses without claiming frame readiness, and independent
stop. Companion Core tests replay the actual startup function and verify three
progress rows and unique bus registrations, including failure and asynchronous
loading outcomes. A separate monitor registration-format race was investigated;
it is not part of the Core startup PR. On 2026-09-08, the driver was tested on a D435i over USB 3 with Core
release.260905.9005d5b unchanged. After the operator started the project, all
three instances were running and the browser displayed all three images.
Concurrent monitoring WebSocket sampling for 30 seconds received:

| channel | dimensions | frames | measured fps | longest inter-frame gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RGB | 1280x720 | 450 | 14.99 | 0.090 s |
| Depth | 640x480 | 451 | 15.00 | 0.078 s |
| Infrared | 640x480 | 451 | 15.02 | 0.118 s |

Every sampled payload was unique; depth decompressed to the expected buffer
size with nonzero measurements. Only the driver image was changed for this
acceptance run. USB disconnect/reconnect during setup changed video-node
numbering and caused stale configured paths to fail; reselect the currently
enumerated device after such a change.
